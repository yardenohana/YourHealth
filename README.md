## About
The 'YourHealth' app brings a simple and interactive interface for performing training and maintaining a healthy lifestyle. It is sometimes difficult for us to conduct training comfortably, and to keep track of our body, especially during the covid. From this need, came the idea to build an app that will allow training management, tracking the number of steps, as well as weight and height.

### Main purpose
* The system allows you to perform exercises under time, manage the user's favorite exercises, track weight, and measure the number of steps.
* The purpose of the app is to monitor health physically and nutritionally while maintaining optimal simplicity and comfort.
* The system keeps the user data, including weight, height, training performed, etc. in the cloud, in a secure manner.
* The app contains a simple login and registration mechanism, which allows each user to manage a personal account to which he can connect from different mobiles.

## Prerequisites
* Realm app & MongoDB Atlas private platforms.
* Internet connection, to set up operations with the Realm application in the cloud - which is an interface that holds between the customer and the operations database.
* Your device must support API 26 and above.
* Android Studio (latest and greatest, cause why not?).

## Development
* This project was developed by [Yarden Ohana](https://www.linkedin.com/in/yardenohana/) with Android Studio during senior year in Software Engineering class.
* Feel free to use this code for your own reasons.

## Installation
* Clone the ```master``` branch from this repo with Android Studio.
* Add your credentials at ```RealmAppConfig.java``` file.
* Create ```Exercises``` & ```Users``` collections in MognoDB atlas.

## Notes
* Some parts require improvement. For example, the weight graph and BMI part, as well as updating weight & height. Feel free to add these.
